# Path-Finder-Visualization---A* Algorithm-

A path-finder algorithm visualization in python . The interface allows the user to pick a start and a end point in a map and allows the user to view the process of the algorithm working and finding the shortest possible path to reach the destination. 

# What is A* Algorithm?

A popular technique used in graph travesals and path finding situations. It is an informed search algorithm which uses factors such as **cost** and **heuristics** to determine its next step on the process to reach the destination.

Refer the following documentation to know more about the A* Algorithm
